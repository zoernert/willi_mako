# Deployment

The deployment scripts are used to deploy the application to production.

## Implementation

The deployment scripts can be found in the root directory. The main files are:

*   `deploy.sh`
*   `quick-deploy.sh`
*   `quick-deploy-fixed.sh`
*   `deploy-chat-config.sh`
*   `deploy-faq-improvements.sh`
*   `deploy-iteration-features.sh`
*   `rollback.sh`
*   `production-setup.sh`
