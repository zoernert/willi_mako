# Testing

The testing scripts are used to test the application's functionality.

## Implementation

The testing scripts can be found in the root directory and the `tests` directory. The main files are:

*   `jest.config.js`
*   `jest.integration.config.js`
*   `playwright.config.ts`
*   `tests/`
*   `test-*.js`
*   `test-*.ts`
*   `test-*.sh`
